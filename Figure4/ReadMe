# Scripts for leg kinematic analyses on intact flies on stop neuron activation (Figure4/StopNeurons_KinematicAnalyses.ipynb)
- Imports parquet file with all raw data (format documented elsewhere: ['Data_Structure'] (https://github.com/bidaye-lab/kinematics_analysis/blob/main/docs/data_structure.md))
- Segments the data into trials where optogenetic stimulation onset happened when each leg was in the swing or stance phase (Fig 4 a-b)
- Calculates swing duration pre and post optogenetic stimulation (Fig 4d)
- Plots the Femur-Tibia flexion angle probability density over the entire trial duration (fig 4c, extended fig 7a)
- Calculates stopping bout related parameters (Extended Fig 3 c-e)
